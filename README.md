# Hierarchy Tree for Unity

> ðŸ§ª **EXPERIMENTAL** This experimental project is still under development, so it may be unstable. It is not optimized and is largely untested. Do **not** use this project in critical projects.

This package renders a tree view in Unity's hierarchy window. Just add it to your project as described below, and that's all â€“ no further steps required.
